## XP Core Values Implemented:

- **Communication**

* Communication played huge role in our team. We had scrum calls twice a week, where we discussed the 
progress of each team member, thereby making necessary decisions and further roadmap.

- **Feedback**

* Each one of the team members gave feedback to one another in the team, during the testing phase, which 
greatly helped us in identifying the bugs. Code has been committed to master after proper review and 
feedback from the team.

- **Respect**

* Throughout the project, each one of us had valued and considered others ideas and suggestions and respected each others availability and timeline.
